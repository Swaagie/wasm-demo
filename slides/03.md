# How does it run?

- Low level VM
  - in the browser: v8
  - on the server: wasmer
  - embedded: wasmtime

> Portability demonstrated through runtime embedding

- Compilation is done
  - Ahead Of Time (AOT): various tools, i.e. emscripten, clang
  - Just In Time (JIT): cranelift

> v8 is able to bootstrap WASM fast(est) due to engine optimizations originally built for JS execution
