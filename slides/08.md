# Run it in a dedicated VM: wasmtime

- Let's install [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) for use in the CLI

```console
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

- Can be embedded in: Rust, C, Python, .NET, Go, etc.

```console
wasmtime run build/release.wasm
```

> Requires a specific module format called WASI: "WebAssembly System Interface".
> Enable use of WASM outside the web by defining an abstract system interface that can interop with any system runtime.
> Also used by Envoyproxy.io to define the abstract interface layer: [wasi.dev](https://wasi.dev/)

Assumes
