# What the WASI

- Calls `_start` by default, let's say "Hello world!"
- What if the browser was also considered an "abstract system": https://www.npmjs.com/package/as-wasi

```console
npm install -D as-wasi
```

```js
import "wasi";
import { Console } from "as-wasi/assembly/index";

Console.log("Hello World!");
```
